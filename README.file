# Basic Calculator in Python

This is a simple Python program that:
- Asks the user to input two numbers.
- Asks the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
- Performs the calculation and displays the result.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where `calculator.py` is saved.
4. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py

   Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

If you want, I can **make you a ready-to-use README file** and show you how to upload it to GitHub alongside your `calculator.py` file so it looks professional.  

Do you want me to prepare that ready-to-upload file for you?
